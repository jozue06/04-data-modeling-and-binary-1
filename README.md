## BITMAP TRANSFORMER LAB
Khoa Huynh and Autumn Curtis

## High-Level Overview
We created an app that takes in user input from a CLI in the following format
* Node
* Starter JS file
* A current BMP file
* New file name 
* Chosen transformation for file

## Exported Modules
* Our app module exports four functions...lighten, darken, invert and random-color


## Random Function
* The random function looks at each [i] and then subtracts the original [i] value from a randomly generated number that is multiplied by 255.  This creates an image with random pixel value.

## Invert Function
* The invert function looks at each [i] and subtracts the value (RGB) from 255, giving us an inverted image.

## Darken Function
* The darken function looks at each [i] and divides in half the value (RGB) from 255, giving us an darkened image.

## Lighten Function
* The lighten function looks at each [i] and returns the lowest number +50, if that number exceeds 50, it will return to 255... giving us a lightened image.
